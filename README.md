# GeometricShapes

<p>This is an essay about how to plot geometric shapes in C. The shapes are functions that accept variables (such as height, base, diagonal, etc.) as parameters, allowing the user to come up with a given shape in any size he/she wants.</p>

<p>Notice: the main() function is empty. In the way it is, the code does nothing. It is up to the user modify the code and try the different functions, with different parameters</p>
